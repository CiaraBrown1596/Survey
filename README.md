### 1. Scrum Sprint Backlog and Task Estimation
| Activity ID  | User Stories  |      To-Do     |  In Progess | Done | Priority | Estimation |
|----------:|---------------|----------------|-------------|------|-----------|------:|
|  1  |  User creates a Survey | To-Do      |      In Progress     |  :heavy_check_mark:  |    1  |   4 hours  |
|  2  |  User adds questions to Survey  | To-Do      |  In Progress            |  :heavy_check_mark:  |     1      |  3 hours  |
|  3  | User can view all Survery Questions |   To-Do   |      In Progress  |  :heavy_check_mark:  |     2      | 3 hours  |
|  4  | User can search for a Survey |    To-Do    |     In Progress   | :heavy_check_mark:      |      1     |  3 hours  |
|  5  | User can submit answers to the Survey |   To-Do  |    In Progress    |  :heavy_check_mark:     |      2     | 2 hours  |
|  6  | Calculate the average score for a Survey |  To-Do    |    In Progress       |  :heavy_check_mark:   |      3     | 3 hours |  
|  7  | Calculate the standard deviation for a Survey|  To-Do  |   In Progress |  :heavy_check_mark:    |      3    | 2 hours  |
|  8  | Calculate the Min and Max scroes for a Survey|   To-Do    |   In Progress   |  :heavy_check_mark:     |      3      | 2 hours  |

### 1.1 Description of Task Estimation
When estimating the time needed to complete these task I gave a longer time frame for completeing the first of the calcuations that I would tackle as I think that once I become comfortable with designing the first calcuation function the average score for a survey, the following ones would be less time consuming as I wil have a better understanding of how to go about implementing such a function.
With regards to the first User story creating a survey I estimated that I would need the greatest amount of time to complete this task as it involves the greatest amount of work and also all of the other activities stem from this as in, the user needs to able able to create a survey initially in order to perform the other User stoires.
The remaining tasks I gave a similar estimation to each of these as I think they all should take roughly the same amount of time to complete.

### 1.2 Velocity metric
The scrum velocity metic is the measure of work completed by a development team within each Sprint. The devolopment team estimates the time and effort needed to develop and test each user story. Velocity is calculated at the end of the Sprint by totaling the Points for all fully completed User Stories.
The formula for the velocity metric is straightforward. It is calculated by dividing the total story points completed by the number of Sprints in which they were completed, example if a total of 60 story points are completed in a totalof 2 Sprints (60 story points/2 Sprints) the teams veleocity would be 30 points per Sprint.
When considering this calculation the team must discuss wheather they are willing to include partially completes stories or only fully completed stories, also the team might work on other tasks such as bug problems or support tasks during the Sprint and these take away time and effort from the Sprints user stories. Sprints should be kept at a consistant lenght as this will effect the velocity, making it inaccurate. The Velocity metric allows developers to understand how much they can get done, and plan their workload for future sprints.
